      <p>
        With over 2 years of hands-on experience, I{`'`}ve developed a solid
        foundation in front-end development, starting with HTML, CSS, and
        JavaScript. My journey took off through various courses and practical
        projects, which led me to master React and later explore the world of
        Next.js and TypeScript.
      </p>
      <p>
        Building my own projects allowed me to dive deeper into creating dynamic
        and responsive applications. This fueled my passion for modern
        frameworks and libraries like Redux for state management and Tailwind
        CSS for efficient styling. I{`'`}m also highly UX/UI oriented, focusing
        on creating seamless, user-friendly interfaces.
      </p>
      <p>
        To enhance my skills further, I{`'`}ve collaborated on more complex
        projects alongside experienced friends, learning the ins and outs of
        professional development. Together, we used Git and GitHub for version
        control, Figma for design and planning, and Jira for managing tasks.
        These experiences allowed me to sharpen my abilities in working with
        RESTful APIs and implement best practices using tools like ESLint for
        code quality.
      </p>
      <p>
        From designing layouts to implementing logic and functionality, I aim to
        create web applications that are not just visually appealing but also
        intuitive and enjoyable for users.
